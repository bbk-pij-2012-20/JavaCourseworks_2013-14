This is the 1st of 2 programming courseworks I completed as part of the
'Programming in Java' module, part of the conversion masters in 
Computer Science at Birkbeck College London, Dec 2013 - Jan 2014.

The coursework task is to implement a contact manager, the interfaces for which
were supplied. We were asked to implement the interfaces (and not to build a much bigger application).

It was also intended that implementing the class ContactManager would serve as a demonstration of an anti-pattern
("the blob" aka "god object"), wherein too much functionality is placed into one class.

(The 2 courseworks followed the exercises (can be seen on this Github account in 'JavaExercises' repository.
The other coursework is also on this account called 'Quiz')
